# Edrys_Module_Missing_LED

This is a challenge module for Edrys-Lite. It communicates with the [Edrys Server](https://github.com/jh-488/edrys_server) through WebSockets and with the [Code Editor](https://github.com/jh-488/Edrys_Code_Editor) using The Edrys API.

After starting the challenge the module sends a message to the server to initiate the a sketch that turn on 2 random LEDs on the board.
When finished, the user can start solving the challenge in the editor. Solving the challenge consist of turning off the already illuminated LEDs and turning on the missing one.
